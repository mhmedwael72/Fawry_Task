1️⃣ Verify DNS Resolution
First, I checked DNS resolution using my system's current DNS (/etc/resolv.conf) and Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8):

Command 1: Using system DNS
dig internal.example.com

=> Result:
The domain name failed to resolve correctly.
Indicates DNS issue or missing internal record.


Command 2: Using Google Public DNS
nslookup internal.example.com 8.8.8.8

=> Result:
Same failure (NXDOMAIN) because internal.example.com is an internal domain not known to public DNS.


/etc/resolv.conf content:

nameserver 10.255.255.254
search domain.name




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2️⃣ Diagnose Service Reachability
Since DNS was failing, I created a manual entry in /etc/hosts:
Modified /etc/hosts: 192.168.10.5 internal.example.com

Testing with Ping:
ping internal.example.com

=>Result:
Name successfully resolves to 192.168.10.5.


Testing with Curl

curl http://internal.example.com

=>Result:

Request times out after ~130 seconds.
Error:curl: (28) Failed to connect to internal.example.com port 80 after 129738 ms: Couldn't connect to server

3️⃣ Trace the Issue – List All Possible Causes

Layer	        Potential Cause
DNS Layer :	Wrong DNS configuration / Missing record
DNS Layer:	Internal DNS server (10.255.255.254) not functioning
Service Layer:	Web server not running (Apache/Nginx stopped)
Service Layer:	Web server listening on wrong port
Network Layer:	Firewall blocking port 80 (HTTP)
Network Layer:	Wrong IP address mapped manually
Host Layer: 	Target server down, rebooting, or disconnected

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4️⃣ Propose and Apply Fixes
For each potential cause:

(1)
Cause : Wrong DNS config			
How to Confirm	: Check with dig and nslookup
Command to Fix : Update /etc/resolv.conf or fix /etc/hosts

2)
Cause :DNS server down		
How to Confirm:	Try to query DNS directly
Command to Fix: Restart internal DNS server


3)
Cause :Web server down		
How to Confirm:	Try telnet IP 80 or nmap IP
Command to Fix: SSH into server and start service ( sudo systemctl restart apache2)


4)
Cause :Wrong port		
How to Confirm:	Scan with nmap
Command to Fix: Correct server config to use port 80


5)
Cause :Firewall blocking		
How to Confirm:	test with telnet IP 80
Command to Fix: Open firewall for HTTP port (sudo ufw allow 80/tcp)


6)
Cause :Server down		
How to Confirm:	ping IP and check network
Command to Fix: Restart server or fix network connection


7)
Cause:Wrong IP mapping		
How to confirm:Confirm with correct network information
command to fix :Correct /etc/hosts
